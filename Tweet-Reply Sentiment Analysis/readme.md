**Introduction**

What is Sentiment Analysis? It is a machine learning technique that automatically analyses and detects the sentiment of text. Here we do Message-level sentiment analysis, i.e. we classify the sentiment of the whole given message (tweet or reply).

**Goal of this project**

The aim of this project is to build a sentiment classification tool which, given a tweet predicts how likely it gets positive, negative or neutral replies. In other words, it is a tool to predict the nature of replies to a tweet is most likely to get.
